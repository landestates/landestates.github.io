<h3>
Do I need an attorney or real estate agent?
</h3><br /><h6>
    We’ve simplified the buying process with straightforward, easy-to-read contracts. Of course, we encourage you to hire a professional if you think it’s necessary, but we’ve done our best to make the process easy for anyone to understand.
</h6><br />

<h3>
How does your money-back guarantee work?
</h3><br />
    <h6>
        We want you to be 100% satisfied with your investment. If you’re not satisfied for any reason with the first 90 days after closing, simply call us, and we will either exchange your parcel for one you like better, or refund your note payments up to that point and take back the deed.
        It’s simple: if you don’t love it, we don’t want you to own it.
        One of the benefits of working with us is that you’re dealing with the actual owner of the property, not some developer or shell corporation.
        And we want you to be happy.

<h3>
Why should I buy from Frontier instead of Craigslist or eBay?
</h3><br />
    <h6>
        Price, quality, simplicity and trust.
        There are a lot of land sellers, but none have as simple and transparent a buying process as ours.
        Our land has been handpicked for access, mountain views and potential appreciation.
    </h6><br />
        <br />
<h3>
Why should I buy from Frontier instead of a real estate agent?
</h3><br />
    <h6>
        A real estate agent’s fees can range from 5% to 8% of the purchase price.
        At Frontier Properties, we eliminate the middleman, saving you even more.
    </h6><br />
<br />
<h3>
How do I apply for owner financing?
</h3><br />
    <h6>
        There is NO application process! No credit checks. You are already pre-approved.
        Simply put, if you can afford the down payment, I’ll finance you.
        And you may qualify for a lower interest rate if you choose to put down a larger down payment.
    </h6><br />
<br />
<h3>
How do I make arrangements to inspect the property before I buy it?
</h3><br />
    <h6>
        Your property isn’t “locked in” until we receive your down payment.
        Before making arrangements to see a specific parcel, we strongly encourage you to pay your down payment to ensure that the property hasn’t been sold to someone else by the time you arrive.
        (Remember, your down payment is covered by our 100% satisfaction guarantee.)
        We’ll then make arrangements with you to visit the property at your own expense.
        Will give you maps, GPS coordinates we’ll even connect you with a local surveyor.
    </h6><br />
<br />
<h3>
What documents do I need to apply for owner financing?
</h3><br />
<h6>
None. Our process is so simple that no documentation is required.
</h6><br />
<br />
<h3>
How long does it take to close on a property after I make my down payment?
</h3>
<br />
    <h6>
        >Once your down payment clears, we’ll send out your entire deed package via email using docusing.com (we are going green by saving tons of paper).
        This packet will include maps, photos, your Land Contract, Promissory Note, and Purchase Sale Agreement.
        Once you sign the documents digitally we will set you up on automatic payments (another way to save trees by avoiding payment coupons).
        Once you pay off your note, we will most likely close via First American Title Company and issue your Warranty Deed along with your title insurance.
        The county will then mail you the original recorded deed for your files. it’s that simple.
        The whole process usually takes about two weeks, and most of that is the time it takes for the county to process the paperwork.
        Once you make your final payment on the property, we’ll Issue you your Warranty Deed.  At that point you own it free and clear.

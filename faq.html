            How much are property taxes?
        </h3><br /><h4>

        </h3><br /><h4>
            We’ve simplified the buying process with straightforward, easy-to-read contracts.
            Of course, we encourage you to hire a professional if you think it’s necessary, but we’ve done our best to make the process easy for anyone to understand.

        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            We want you to be 100% satisfied with your investment.
            If you’re not satisfied for any reason with the first 90 days after closing, simply call us, and we will either exchange your parcel for one you like better, or refund your note payments up to that point and take back the deed.
            It’s simple: if you don’t love it, we don’t want you to own it.
            One of the benefits of working with us is that you’re dealing with the actual owner of the property, not some developer or shell corporation.
            And we want you to be happy.

        <h3>
            Why should I buy from Real Estates Properties North America (REPNA) instead of Craigslist or eBay?
        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            Price, quality, simplicity and trust.
            There are a lot of land sellers, but none have as simple and transparent a buying process as ours.
            Our land has been handpicked for access, mountain views and potential appreciation.
        </h4><br />
        <br />
        <h3>
            Why should I buy from REPNA instead of a real estate agent?
        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            A real estate agent’s fees can range from 5% to 8% of the purchase price.
            At REPNA, we eliminate the middleman, saving you even more.
        </h4><br />
        <br />
        <h3>
            How do I apply for owner financing?
        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            There is NO application process and no credit checks. You are already pre-approved.
            And you may qualify for a lower interest rate if you choose to put down a larger down payment.
        </h4><br />
        <br />
        <h3>
            How do I make arrangements to inspect the property before I buy it?
        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            Your property isn’t “locked in” until we receive your down payment.
            Before making arrangements to see a specific parcel, we strongly encourage you to pay your down payment to ensure that the property hasn’t been sold to someone else by the time you arrive.
            (Remember, your down payment is covered by our 100% satisfaction guarantee.)
            We’ll then make arrangements with you to visit the property at your own expense.
            Will give you maps, GPS coordinates we’ll even connect you with a local surveyor.
        </h4><br />
        <br />
        <h3>
            What documents do I need to apply for owner financing?
        </h3><br />
        <h4>
            None. We will eventually need your Social Security Number for tax purposes. I prefer to get this information over the phone for your security.
        </h4><br />
        <br />
        <h3>
            How long does it take to close on a property after I make my down payment?
        </h3>
        <br />
               <h4>
            Once your down payment clears, we’ll send out your entire deed package via email using signnow.com.
            This packet will include maps, photos, your Land Contract, Promissory Note, and Purchase Sale Agreement.
            Once you sign the documents digitally we will set you up on automatic payments.
            Once you pay off your note, we will most likely close via First American Title Company and issue your Warranty Deed along with your title insurance.
            The county will then mail you the original recorded deed for your files. it’s that simple.
            The whole process usually takes about two weeks, and most of that is the time it takes for the county to process the paperwork.
            Once you make your final payment on the property, we’ll issue you your Warranty Deed.  At that point you own it free and clear.
        </h4><br />
        <h3>
            Recording the deed with Owner Financing before the end of the term?
        </h3>
        <br />
        <h4>
            This virtually doesn’t happen in this space, however the question does exist.
            If investors insist on recording the deed. The terms will need to be adjusted.
            We need to run an additional application and credit check to assess an ability to pay, our standards are detailed below.
            After qualifying, this type of investment has the lowest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan-to-value_ratio">Loan-to-Value ratio</a> in the industry, 65, see current regulations <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/2000-8700.html">here</a>.
            This means, at a minimum virtually all lenders are required to obtain a down payment of 35% of the loan, REPNA holds those minimum standards, and factors additional macro and micro market metrics.
